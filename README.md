🔍 Data Storytelling: Understanding Pizza Palace’s Sales Landscape
Pizza Palace’s business data reveals a comprehensive look at product performance, customer preferences, and sales trends. The visuals demonstrate how various pizza types, sizes, and time frames contribute to the company’s total income of 899.65K.

📌 Key Insights

🍕 1. Customer Preferences
Chicken Pizzas (30.03%) are the most popular among customers, followed by Supreme (24.18%), Veggie (23.5%), and Classic (22.29%).

This suggests a strong leaning toward protein-rich and possibly spicy pizzas.

📏 2. Performance by Size
Large (L) size dominates sales by volume and revenue.

Small (S) and Medium (M) sizes perform moderately well.

XL and XXL sizes contribute significantly less, potentially indicating either low demand or higher price sensitivity for large portions.

📦 3. Sales by Category and Size
Chicken pizzas in L and M sizes show consistently high sales across all categories.

Supreme and Veggie pizzas also perform well in L size, suggesting this is the preferred size across the board.

📅 4. Time-Based Sales Trends
Quarterly income peaked in April 2015 (229.2K), followed by a decline through October 2015 (219K).

Monthly sales are strongest in July, showing a seasonal peak (possibly summer holidays/festivities).

Sales dropped sharply in October and November, indicating potential off-peak months.

📈 5. Best-Selling Pizza Types
Top performers: thai_ckn, bbq_ckn, cali_ckn, and classic_dlx.

These types all sold over 40K units, making them core contributors to total sales.

✅ Recommendations

🎯 1. Focus on Top Performers
Expand promotions and availability of Chicken and Supreme categories in L and M sizes.

Consider bundling top-selling pizzas like thai_ckn and bbq_ckn with popular drinks/sides.

🧪 2. Reevaluate XXL and XL Sizes
Explore reasons for low sales: Are prices too high? Is value perception low?

Test limited-time promotions or size-based discounts to stimulate demand.

📆 3. Seasonal Promotions
Leverage peak sales months like July and April for major marketing campaigns.

Offer holiday specials or loyalty programs in low sales months (Oct–Nov) to balance income.

🧠 4. Product Development
Given the success of unique options like thai_ckn and bbq_ckn, explore more gourmet or international-inspired flavors.

Use customer feedback and A/B testing to introduce limited edition pizzas each quarter.

📉 5. Monitor Declining Trends
Income has been declining since Q2 2015—investigate root causes (e.g., customer churn, competitor activity, operational issues).
